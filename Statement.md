# Project Statement  
## Number Guessing Game (Python)

### 1. Project Overview
The Number Guessing Game is a Python-based terminal application designed to allow users to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts. The game provides feedback on each guess and maintains a cumulative score across rounds.

---

### 2. Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive, user-friendly command-line game that demonstrates the use of core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and random number generation.

---

### 3. Scope
- The game runs entirely on a terminal/console.
- The user receives hints after every incorrect guess.
- A score system is maintained throughout multiple game rounds.
- The number to be guessed lies between predefined bounds.

---

### 4. Target Users
This project is intended for:
- Beginners learning Python fundamentals  
- Students practicing problem-solving and logic building  
- Anyone looking for a simple terminal-based game  

---

### 5. Functional Description
- The system generates a random secret number.
- The player is given 6 attempts to guess correctly.
- If the guess is too high or too low, the system provides appropriate hints.
- The score increases when the user guesses correctly.
- The player can choose to replay the game.

---

### 6. Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **random** module
- Basic terminal input/output functions

---

### 7. Features
- Random number generation  
- Attempt-limited gameplay  
- Real-time hints  
- Global scoring system  
- Replay option  

---

### 8. Expected Outcome
Users will be able to:
- Play a fully functional number guessing game  
- Understand the logic flow of a simple Python application  
- Experience interactive gameplay on the terminal  

---

### 9. Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the creation of an interactive Python terminal game. It utilizes essential programming concepts and offers an engaging experience while being simple enough for beginners to understand and expand upon.
