● Features
<br>
A number guessing game's main features include randomly generating a secret number within a specific range and allowing the user to input their guess. The system provides feedback (too high or too low) after each attempt until the number is correctly guessed or the maximum attempts are reached.
<br>
<br>
● Technologies/tools used
<br>
1. Programming Language
<br>

<br>
Used to implement the game logic, loops, conditions, and user input handling.
<br>
<br>
2. Python Standard Library
<br>
random module
<br>
Generates the random number between 1 and 100.
<br>
Function used: random.randint(1, 100)
<br>
<br>
3. Runtime Environment
<br>
Python Interpreter
<br>
Executes the .py file and runs the game logic through the terminal.
<br>
<br>
● Steps to install & run the project
<br>
● Instructions for testing
<br>
1.Open Vs code with having an extension .py and then run this code their 
 Before testing the Guessing Number Game, ensure the following:
 <br>
The project file (e.g., guessing_game.py) is saved on your computer
<br>
To verify Python installation, run:
<br>
python --version
<br>
<br>
4. How to Run the Program
<br>
Open Command Prompt / Terminal
<br>
Navigate to the folder where the Python file is saved:
<br>
cd path/to/your/project
<br>
Run the game using:
<br>
python guessing_game.py
<br>
<br>
5. Expected Program Flow
<br>
System randomly generates a number between 1 and 100
<br>
User enters a guess
<br>
Program displays:
<br>
“Too high!” if the guess > target
